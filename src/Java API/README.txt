I'm not entirely sure if we should use CommandToMove.java or CommandToMove2.java.

CommandToMove.java fits the description of how Kevin wants it, like the methods in CommandToMove.java are idential to the commands he wrote on the whiteboard, but the Beaver class requires the FileWriter class as a parameter so the methods inside the Beaver class can write its commands to the file.

While CommandToMove2.java does not require the Beaver class to have the FileWriter object as a parameter, but we need to write extra syntax in CommandToMove2.java and that doesn't look quite similar to the way the method calls on the whiteboard looks.

Either way, both CommandToMove and Beaver classes does the same thing, but in different syntax.

CommandToMove.java requires Beaver.java
CommandToMove2.java requires Beaver2.java
